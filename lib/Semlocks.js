/**
 * Acquires semaphore locks and calls a callback when they are obtained.  Note
 * that the callback is called in the tick immediately following the tick in
 * which the last semaphore was locked, in order to ensure the handle is
 * returned and available when the callback executes.
 * @param {string|Array} sems The semaphore, or array of semaphores, to be
 *      locked before calling the callback.
 * @param {{}|function} [opts] An optional set of key/value options.  They are:
 * @param {number} [opts.wait=null] The number of milliseconds to wait for a
 *      lock.  If this time limit is reached and the locks have not all been
 *      obtained, the callback is executed with an error argument.  Default is
 *      unbounded.
 * @param {number} [opts.ttl=null] The 'time-to-live': a number of milliseconds
 *      that a callback can take to release all its locks before they are
 *      forcibly released and a 'killed' event is fired.  Note that this does
 *      not halt the execution of the callback.  Default is unbounded.
 * @param {boolean} [opts.instant=false] If true, the callback will be called
 *      with an error argument if the locks cannot be immediately obtained.
 * @param {number} [opts.priority=2] The priority of this request.  Locks
 *      are awarded in priority order, with lower values coming first and
 *      higher values coming only after lower values have been serviced.  Equal
 *      priorities are awarded in the order in which they were requested.
 * @param {function} cb A callback to be executed when all the locks are
 *      obtained, or when the locks cannot be obtained due to the `wait` or
 *      `instant` options above.  The callback is called in the tick
 *      immediately after the acquisition of the last semaphore, with the
 *      following arguments:
 *          - {Error|null} err: An error object, if locks could not be obtained
 *            due to the `wait` or `instant` options.
 *          - {function} release([sem]): Releases all currently held locks for
 *            this request if sem is not specified, or releases only the
 *            specified semaphore if that argument is provided.  The sem
 *            argument can also be an array of semaphore names to be released.
 * @returns {number} A handle allowing this request to be forcibly canceled by
 *      the {@link #cancel} function.
